# Pidgey Stat Requirements


### Overview

We need to catch a Pidgey, at north of Viridian City.

But it's not that much easy since we need specials stats and requirements


### Stats

Pidgey don't need any special stats for the glitch to work. Only need some kind of HP.

But Bulbasaur need to be at 16special otherwise it'll not work.


### Requirements

Pidgey only need to have his HP (health) at the proper amount.

It will work if he got 8, 10, 13, 15, 16 or 17HP.

At 8 or 13HP we don't need to Hold B while going to Saffron City, otherwise we need to Hold B while moving.

At 16HP we need to PC Save at Saffron City (by swaping box) to continue the run.


### Probability

Catching a Pidgey with the needed amount of health it's easy and it's 100% probable to get one without reset for time.

But because Bulbasaur need to have a Special of 16 it result in a probability nearly 40%.
