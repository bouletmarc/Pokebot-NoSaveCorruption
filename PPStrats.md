# PP Stat Requirements


### Overview

We need a certain kind of PP attack available, on certain kind of attack, at certain kind of position.

Seems odd to read this like so? but you will understand my sentence below fast.


### Stats

Bulbasaur need to be at level 8 or 10 otherwise it's not working. The bot will reset if he reach the level 9.

It would take too much time to hit the level 10 with again the perfect amount of PP available.


### Requirements

About the PP we need 16PP available on Tackle, 36PP on Growl and any other attack learned.

We need to tranfert Tackle at the Position 2 and Growl at the Position 3, that's why we need a 3rd attack.

The PP amount of the 3rd attack (now in position 1) should not mind, but the bot use Leech Seed which is

sometimes learned to Bulbasaur when he reach level 7 or 8, and he dont use any PP on it so 10PP to leech seed.


### Probability

The probability of working here are extremely high, the only know issue it's if we start battling Weedle

at level 6 and we got a little exp earned, we might go directly to level 8 which makig Bulbasaur not neccesary

learning leech seed and will result into a reset because we don't have 3 attacks. Sometimes he can use too much

tackle before being in Pewter City, which also result in a reset because it would take too much time to heal and

perform the "PP strat" after the healing. After all, I could say the probability are nearly 80-90% chance of work.
